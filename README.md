The project goal is to implement a culinary recipe website. The project mimics a Full Stack development scenario in which, we, the developers, receive an initial Product Requirements Document (PRD) and are asked to implement it. 
The project was built in three phases:
 
### [First Phase – API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/shmera6/Assignment3.1/1.0.5)

The goal of the API file is to create a “contract” between the client and the server. It establishes an agreement on the resources and actions of the server and how to get/request them. We used swagger with OpenAPI Specification – Version V3 format.
 
### [Second Phase – Backend Development]()

We implemented the server side using NODE.JS and EXPRESS.JS, according to the API written in the first phase. The recipe data is acquired through the API of [spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). All the data of the clients is stored using AZURE DB. The system was engineered to handle and administer routes, cookies, users, and passwords.
 

### [Third Phase – Frontend development]()

the frontend was developed using Vue.JS, and Vue CLI tooling. Additionally, we used the Bootstrap design library. A secondary goal of the design was to develop separate pages and components.
